title: Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)
---

[clever way to emulate an analog signal by reducing the average current over time]

[time that it's on is called the "duty cycle"]

![50% and 25% Duty Cycle](PWM_50p_v_25p_DutyCycle.svg)

[increase frequency resolution, but still same duty cycle]

![50% Duty Cycle @2x frequency resolution](PWM_50p_2xRes_DutyCycle.svg)


[built-in hardware generator available on several pins]

[can also generate in software]
