title: Analog I/O
---

[Analog ports can operate at a range of voltages between 0 and 3.3v, which is especially useful when reading analog sensors that supply their data as a voltage reading, rather than a digital signal.]

[1024 bit resolution (0-1023 value)]
[3.3v max; be careful with inputs]

## Input
[sample code reading a thermistor or other sensor]

## Output
[sample code/project driving an LED with a potentiometer]
