The **BMP085** is a high-precision, low-power barometric pressure sensor. The BMP085 offers a measuring range of 300 to 1100 hPa with an absolute accuracy of down to 0.03 hPa. It's based on piezo-resistive technology for EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity as well as long term stability. This sensor supports a voltage supply between 1.8 and 3.6VDC. It is designed to be connected directly to a micro-controller via the I2C bus.

## Purchasing



The BMP085 sensor is available as a breakout board from the following supplier(s):

An example will be available once the driver is implemented.
