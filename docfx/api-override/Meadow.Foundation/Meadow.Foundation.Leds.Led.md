An LED is a diode (a component that attempts to let current flow only one way through it) that emits light when voltage is applied to it. Because it is a diode, it only works when a voltage is applied one way. For this reason, LEDs usually have one lead longer (the Cathode) than the other (the Anode). The cathode (longer leg) indicates that it should be hooked to the positive (+) side of a circuit.

Unlike the `PwmLed`, in which you can pass the forward voltage (voltage drop) of the led to limit its current, to use `Led` it is required to limit the current to the LED using a resistor.

The following example shows how to turn on and off the LED using the `IsOn` property, and uses a `StartBlink(onDuration, offDuration)` API method to make the LED blink staying on for 500ms (0.5s) and off for 1000ms (1s):

```csharp
public class LedApp : App<F7Micro, LedApp>
{
    public LedApp()
    {
        // create a new Led on pin 8
        var led = new Led(Device.CreateDigitalOutputPort(Device.Pins.D08));

        while (true)
        {
            led.IsOn = true;    // Led ON
            Thread.Sleep(3000); // 3 seconds
            led.IsOn = false;   // Led OFF
            Thread.Sleep(2000); // 2 seconds
            led.IsOn = true;    // Led ON
            Thread.Sleep(1000); // 1 second

            led.StartBlink(500, 1000);
            Thread.Sleep(5000); // 5 seconds
            led.Stop();
            Thread.Sleep(1500); // 1.5 seconds, ensure last blink cycle is complete
        }
    }
}
```
