The TEA5767 FM module is based on the TEA5767GH which is a single-chip, electronically tuned, FM stereo radio for low-voltage applications with fully integrated Intermediate Frequency (IF) selectivity and demodulation. 

It can be connected to a microcontroller through an I2C interface to digitally control its tuning frequency and other characteristics, giving room for opportunities to digitize some of its operations. It comes with tow headphone jacks, one for connection to a headphone/speaker while the other is for connection to the antenna which usually comes with the module.

### Code Example

The following example shows how to initialize a TEA5767 and look for radio stations:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using Meadow;
using Meadow.Devices;
using Meadow.Foundation.Audio.Radio;

namespace TEA5767_Sample
{
    public class Program
    {
        static IApp _app; 
        public static void Main()
        {
            _app = new App();
        }
    }
    
    public class App : AppBase<F7Micro, App>
    {
        public App ()
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Initialize App");

            Console.WriteLine("Create I2C bus");
            var i2cBus = Device.CreateI2cBus();

            Console.WriteLine("Create TEA5767 instance");
            var radio = new TEA5767(i2cBus);

            Console.WriteLine($"Current frequency: {radio.GetFrequency()}");

            for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
            {
                Thread.Sleep(1000);

                radio.SearchNextSilent();

                Console.WriteLine($"Current frequency: {radio.GetFrequency()}");
            }

            radio.SelectFrequency(94.5f);
        }
    }
}
```

### Circuit Example

To wire a TEA5767 to your Meadow board, connect the following:

| TEA5767 | Meadow Pin    |
|---------|---------------|
| GND     | GND           |
| SCL     | D08 (SCL Pin) |
| SDA     | D07 (SDA Pin) |
| VCC     | 3V3           |

It should look like the following diagram:
