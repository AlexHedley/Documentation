## Force and Amount; Measuring Electricity

Force - Volts. Voltage. 
Amperage - Quantity of electrons





## Electrical Potential

[volts]


## Amps (amount of electrons flowing) - move this later?

[coulombs per second]
[6,242,000,000,000,000,000,000 (6.242 x 10^18)]

## Electromotive Force (EMF), Volts, and the ability to do work.

[Charges can build build up.]
[negative charge (too few electrons) and a postive charge (too many electrons)]

Water analogies

Waterfall; width = amps, height = volts

## Insulators

Materials that don't readily let electrons flow are said to be _insulators_. Materials such as glass and wood, are good insulators.

Metal oxides (metal that have oxygen atoms bound to them) often insulate, even though the same metal without oxygen will conduct. Gasses usually make good insulators, too, because the atoms are too far apart to exchange electrons.

## Resistors

Some materials let electrons flow in a moderate manner. They are neither excellent conductors, nor absolute insulators. These materials _resist_ the flow of electrical current, but don't impede it completely. Carbon, for instance, is one of these materials. And by mixing in other materials with it, such as clay, the resistance can be changed. By precisely controlling material mixes, resistors can be made that reduce electrical current by specific amounts.

We measure resistance in **Ohms**, which are often expressed in _ohms per unit length_, such as 80 ohms per meter, or similar.

## Semiconductors

Some materials, such as silicon, can be made to conduct or insulate rather well. This is usually done during manufacturing, through the use of adding, or _doping_, various materials, or even physically altering the structure of the material itself, to behave a particular way. 

[diodes can be made to only let electrons flow a certain way!]
