title: Part 2 - Practicals of Electrical Theory
---

In part 1 of our electronics primer we got an understanding of the physical nature of electricity. In this part, we're going to start to look at some of the practical aspects that arise from the atomic behavior of electricy.

## Measuring Electricty; Amount and Force

When talking about electricity and working with electronic circuits, there are two aspects that describe current that are important:

 * **Amperage** - Measured in amps, this is the quantity of electrons that are being moved.
 * **Voltage** - Measured in volts, this is the amount of force in which those electrons are bing moved.

Water is used as a common analogy here. Imagine a waterfall; the width of the waterfall determines the quanity of water that is moving, and the height of the waterfall determines the pressure, or force, of the water at the bottom.

### Amperage (Amperes/Amps/A)

One of the simplest (though not actually the official) definitions of an [Ampere (amp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere) is 1 [_coulomb_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb) of charge carriers passing through a given location per second. 

One coulomb is equal to 6.242 x10^18 (6,242,000,000,000,000,000,000) charge carriers. A fantastically large number, but given the relative size of electrons, one can imagine that number of charges moving on a relatively modest wire. Consider household wiring, which is typically 14 or 12 gauge, and rated at carrying 10 or 15 amps (at 120 volts), respectively.

To get an idea of the amount of work that can be done with that number of electrons, consider the following household appliances and their amperage:

| Appliance                       | Amperage |
|---------------------------------|--------------|
| 60 Watt incandescent light bulb | 500mA (0.5A) |
| 10 Watt LED (60 Watt incandescent equivalent) | ~100mA (0.1A) |
| Hair Dryer | 15 amps |


### Electromagnetic Force/Potential (Voltage)

Force in relative.

A 100' Waterfall at different altitudes is still a 100' waterfall.

Perhaps a pipe is a better analogy, because a vacuum means you can pull it

## Wattage

Because in order to properly describe the amount of work that eletrical current can do you need to use both Amperage and Voltage, we have a convenience unit called a [Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt) that can be described as follows:

```
Watts = Volts * Current
```




100 watts = 120 volts * x Amps

5/6 amp = 100 watts @ 120 volts

iPad Charger = 2 amps @ 5v (10 Watts)
Netduino @ 5volts = 125 milliamps (maximum), 30-40ma (normal)








## Insulators

Materials that don't readily let electrons flow are said to be _insulators_. Materials such as glass and wood, are good insulators.

Metal oxides (metal that have oxygen atoms bound to them) often insulate, even though the same metal without oxygen will conduct. Gasses usually make good insulators, too, because the atoms are too far apart to exchange electrons.

## Resistors

Some materials let electrons flow in a moderate manner. They are neither excellent conductors, nor absolute insulators. These materials _resist_ the flow of electrical current, but don't impede it completely. Carbon, for instance, is one of these materials. And by mixing in other materials with it, such as clay, the resistance can be changed. By precisely controlling material mixes, resistors can be made that reduce electrical current by specific amounts.

We measure resistance in **Ohms**, which are often expressed in _ohms per unit length_, such as 80 ohms per meter, or similar.

## Semiconductors

Some materials, such as silicon, can be made to conduct or insulate rather well. This is usually done during manufacturing, through the use of adding, or _doping_, various materials, or even physically altering the structure of the material itself, to behave a particular way. 

[diodes can be made to only let electrons flow a certain way!]
