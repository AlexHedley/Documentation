[Light Emitting Diode - a diode that lights up!]

[diagram symbol, a diode with arrows]

[only work with current one way - one leg is longer than the other]

[diagram]

[need to have current limited so they don't burn out]

[two ways to do that, either [use a resistor](Driving_an_LED_w_Resistor), or drive it with a [PWM signal](Driving_an_LED_w_PWM)]

[Can also be used as a light sensor!]

[come in many colors, packages, and powers]
