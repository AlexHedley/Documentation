title: Relays

Relays are electrical switching devices that use a small amount of current to control a much larger amount of current. Conceptually, they perform a similar function to a transistor, except that the controlling circuit is usually mechanically separate from the power circuit being controlled. This allows for very high currents to be switched, and also different types of currents. For example, a common type of relay is a [DC](/Hardware/Circuits/Current_Types/DC) controlled [AC](/Hardware/Circuits/Current_Types/AC) relay which uses a small amount of DC current (often supplied by a microcontroller), to control an AC circuit. This type of setup is common in appliances and other applications in which the logic circuit is DC, but various mechanical parts of the appliance are powered by AC current, such as motors, or heating elements.
