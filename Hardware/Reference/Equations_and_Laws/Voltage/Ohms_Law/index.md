title: OHM's Law
---

The amount of current flowing through a conductor is proportional to the voltage applied across the conductor.  This is true of all conductors with the exception of super-conductors.  Mathematically this is stated as:

V = k &sdot; I

where;

- V is the voltage (in volts) drop across the conductor
- I is the current (in amps) flowing through the conductor
- k is the constant of proportionality

In this case, the constant of proportionality is replaced by the resistance (in ohms) of the conductor.  The equation becomes:

V = I &sdot; R

Given two of the three values it is possible to calculate the unknown value.

This equation can be rearranged to allow the calculation of the current:

I = V / R

or the resistance:

R = V / I

See [Driving LEDs with Current Limiting Resistors](/Hardware/Reference/Components/LEDs/Driving_w_Resistor/) for an example of using Ohms Law.
