In part 4, we learned that as current (amperage) flows through a component that has resistance, it's limited proportionally to the amount of resistance that it has, and this relationship is codified in ohm's law. 

[while Ohm's law gave us some elementary tools to analyze

[we need another set of stuff]


In this part, we're going to look at another part of circuit theory and 

[formulated by Gustav Kirchhoff]

[these laws are incredibly useful in analyzing circuits]
