title: DC Circuit Analysis
---

In part 4, we learned about Ohm's law and used it to calculate power and resistance in parallel and series resistance circuits. And while Ohm's law gave us some great insights into how circuits work, we need some additional tools to be able to fully analyze a circuit, especially when it comes to voltage.

In this part of the tutorial, we're going to look at another part of circuit theory by examining two laws formulated by [Gustav Krichhoff](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gustav_Kirchhoff) in 1845 that build on Ohm's law and help to provide a more complete look at how DC circuits work. 

In doing so, we're also going to build our first practical circuits that deal with voltage division and put all that we've learned to use.
