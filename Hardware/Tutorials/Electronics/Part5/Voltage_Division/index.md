[something interesting happens in series resistances]

[voltage division]

![](../Voltage_Divider_Network.svg)

[example voltage division circuit]

[ratio of resistances determines what division occurs]

### Current

[resistance of the resistors determines how much current]

[use the largest resistance while still providing the necessary current, so as to be power efficient]
