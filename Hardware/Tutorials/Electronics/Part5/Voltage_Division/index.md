title: Voltage Division

Examining Ohm's law in the context of Kirchhoff's voltage law reveals an interesting fact about the voltage drop after each resistor in a series, in that the ratio of resistances determines how much the voltage is reduced at each interval. Consider the following 

![Voltage Divider Network Illustration](../Voltage_Divider_Network.svg)

```
Vn = Vs - (I * Rn)
V1 = 5V - (.25A * 2Ω) = 0.5V
V1 = 5V - (.25A * 6Ω) = 1.5V
V1 = 5V - (.25A * 12Ω) = 3V
```

[something interesting happens in series resistances]

[voltage division]


[ratio of resistances determines what division occurs]

### Current

[resistance of the resistors determines how much current]

[use the largest resistance while still providing the necessary current, so as to be power efficient]
