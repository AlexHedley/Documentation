title: Current Types
---

In part 1, we learned that electricity is quantified in two ways; voltatge and amperage, which describe force and quantity, respectively. However, in addition to those quanitfiers, there is one other characteristic of electricity that has to do with the motion of the current. Electricity comes in two forms of charge carrier movement; _direct current_ and _alternating current_.

## Direct Current

[Direct current is a direct push. Electrons flow in one direction, continuously.]

[what we use for logic and digital circuits]

## Alternating Current






Let's look at direct current in more detail, and then we'll learn more about alternating current.
