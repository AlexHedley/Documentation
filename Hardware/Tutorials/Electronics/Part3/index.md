title: Part 3 - Resistance and Ohm's Law

## Resistors

Some materials let electrons flow in a moderate manner. They are neither excellent conductors, nor absolute insulators. These materials _resist_ the flow of electrical current, but don't impede it completely. Carbon, for instance, is one of these materials. And by mixing in other materials with it, such as clay, the resistance can be changed. By precisely controlling material mixes, resistors can be made that reduce electrical current by specific amounts.

We measure resistance in **Ohms**, which are often expressed in _ohms per unit length_, such as 80 ohms per meter, or similar.
