title: Part 3 - Resistance and Ohm's Law
---

In part two, we learned about the relationship between amperage (quantity) and voltage (force) of electricity. In this part, we're going to explore another pieces of that fundamental relationship, resistence, and how that relationship is codified in _Ohm's Law_.
