title: Resistor Power Rating and Tolerance
---

In addition to amount of resistance, resistors have two other important characteristics that describe them: _power rating_ and _tolerance_.

## Power Rating

When power flows through a resistor, some of the energy is converted into heat. The amount of heat a resistor can safely dissipate is 

 are rated to be able to safely dissipate up to a certain amount of power. This is a resistors _power rating_.

[rating - 1/4watt, so forth, is for the amount of heat it can dissipate]

## Tolerance
