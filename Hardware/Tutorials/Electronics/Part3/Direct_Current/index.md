title: Direct Current
---

[Direct current (DC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current) specifies a unidirectional flow of electrons; that is they flow in one direction only.

Direct current is the type of current output by batteries, and with a few exceptions, is nearly always the type of current that power logic and digital circuits. For that reason, most of this tutorial will focus on direct current.

Direct curent is also used in [long distance, high power, electrical transmission lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current) (usually >250kV) because of lower electrical losses.

Netduino provides two _power rails_ that supply 5V and 3.3V direct current. They can be found on the power header:

Let's examine AC next.
