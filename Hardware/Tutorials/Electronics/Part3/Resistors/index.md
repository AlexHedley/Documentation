title: Resistors

In part two, we learned about the relationship between amperage (quantity) and voltage (force) of electricity. In this part, we're going to explore another pieces of that fundamental relationship, resistence, and how that relationship is codified in _Ohm's Law_.

Some materials let electrons flow in a moderate manner. They are neither excellent conductors, nor absolute insulators. These materials _resist_ the flow of electrical current, but don't impede it completely. Carbon, for instance, is one of these materials. And by mixing in other materials with it, such as clay, the resistance can be changed. By precisely controlling material mixes, resistors can be made that reduce electrical current by specific amounts.

We measure resistance in **Ohms**, which are often expressed in _ohms per unit length_, such as `80 ohms per meter`, or similar, and often, the Greek letter for Omega (`Î©`) is used as the abbreviation. 

From a physical standpoint, resistance occurs because some electrons get [deflected when passing through the atomic lattice of the resistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_electron_model). Some of these electrons bounce off and are converted to heat energy, radiating away from the resistor.

The heat that a resistor can safely dissipate is dependent on the amount of current that passes through it. So resistors are _rated_ for different amounts of power, measured in watts.
