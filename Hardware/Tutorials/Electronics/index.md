### Part 3 - Current Types and Power Sources



### Part 4 - Resistance & Ohm's Law - Coming Soon!

Part 3 expands the relationship between amperage and voltage, and adds another piece to the fundamental laws of electricity; resistance. In doing so, it explores one of the most important laws in electricity, Ohm's law, and explains how to use it.
