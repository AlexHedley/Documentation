title: Source, Load, and Ground
---

[parts of a circuit fall into these general categories]

## Source

[voltage source or generator]

[Netduino has both 5V and 3.3V sources]


## Load

[where the amps go]


### Voltage Drop

[voltage drop]

#### Kirchoff's 2nd Law


## Common and Ground


Both common and ground:
[reference point from which voltages are measured]
[might be 0V. might be higher. goes back to relativity of voltage drop.]


Ground is
[where electrons go.][an infinite sink, that is something that can absorb an infinite amount of charge carriers. the earth is ground]

symbol:
[ground symbol]

[in circuits you also have common and floating return]
