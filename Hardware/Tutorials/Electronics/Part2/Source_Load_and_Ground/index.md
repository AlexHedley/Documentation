title: Source, Load, and Ground
---

[Thus far, we've talked about electrical current in an open-ended way; 

But circuits are actually closed loops, hence the name "circuit."


[using another analogy, a river that connects back on itself]

[water goes around, and then there is a force that impels it at one point - this is the voltage drop]

[imagine a dam - but instead of backing up when it's dammed, the whole river stops - this is because of there's no where for it to "pool" generally speaking]

[parts of a circuit fall into these general categories]

[Kirchoff's second law, voltage law[


## Source

[voltage source or generator]

[Netduino has both 5V and 3.3V sources]


## Load

[where the amps/current goes]

[different components have different current loads. hair dryer might use 12A, but a phone charger might use 1A]

[the amperage that a device uses is dependent on its overall resistance]

### Voltage Drop

[voltage drop]

#### Kirchoff's 2nd Law

[Kirchoff's Voltage Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_voltage_law_.28KVL.29) states that the sum of the voltages in any circuit loop (source -> load -> return/common) must be zero. Which means that if the source is 5V, then the total load must drop 5V to zero. Let's examine a typical single resistor circuit:

## Common and Ground


Both common and ground:
[reference point from which voltages are measured]
[might be 0V. might be higher. goes back to relativity of voltage drop.]


Ground is
[where electrons go.][an infinite sink, that is something that can absorb an infinite amount of charge carriers. the earth is ground]

symbol:
[ground symbol]

[in circuits you also have common and floating return]
