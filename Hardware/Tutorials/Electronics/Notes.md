### Kirchoff's Voltage Law

[Kirchoff's Voltage Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_voltage_law_.28KVL.29) states that the sum of the voltages in any circuit loop (source -> load -> return/common) must be zero. Which means that if the source is 5V, then the total load must drop 5V to zero. Let's examine a typical single resistor circuit:
