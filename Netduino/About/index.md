title: About Netduino
---

(general info)

[open source hardware platform that runs the .net micro framework.]

[similar in concept to arduino, but much more powerful, with high level language constructs, threading, event handling, etc.]

[used by folks to build; home automation, industrial machinery like CNCs, etc. (need to come up with a list of cool things folks have done)]

[code in Visual Studio on Windows or Xamarin Studio on Mac]

# Older Netduinos

[some older models, too, but they've been end of lifed]
