## Announcing Wilderness Labs Dev Camp 2021!

Join us, on **November 18th, 2021**, for the second annual Dev Camp. It'll be an action packed day of talks, lightning sessions, and an afternoon of deep-dive workshops. This year we'll be focusing on **building real world, production-grade IoT solutions with Meadow**.

Follow along as we explore the [Clima](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Clima) project; a real-world, solar-powered, custom embedded-IoT solution that tracks climate from a suite of sensors, saves data locally for access via bluetooth and a RESTful Web API, and also synchronizes that data to the cloud.

And don't miss the keynote where cofounder/CEO, Bryan Costanich, will talk about the state of the industry and the IoT revolution.

And best of all, **it's free and will stream worldwide to registered guests**!

## Customer + Project Show & Tell

Are you building something with Meadow? We're going to put together a customer vignette montage, and want you to be in it! Big, small, fun, silly, serious, whatever; let us know about what your building, and we'll reach out to help you put together some quick clips for inclusion in the montage. 

[Tell us about your project!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZNICTNKdrDq_U6ZbE6y-AOeSmT0ygp9DnBi6F4m0oK6FVlg/viewform)


## Submit a Session

Have a session on hardware you're dying to give? Let us know. We'll be doing super fast-paced 10-15 minute talks and longer workshops.

If you're planning on attending, we highly recommend picking up a [Hack Kit Pro](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/meadow-f7-micro-development-board-w-hack-kit-pro)! Most of the hacks that we'll be covering are based on the components in it.
