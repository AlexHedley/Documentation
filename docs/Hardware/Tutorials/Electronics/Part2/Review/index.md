 * The amount of work electricity can do is described in terms of _amperage_ and _voltage_.
 * _Amperage (A)_ describes the quantity of charge carriers flowing in an electric current.
 * _Current_ is a colloquial term that means amperage.
 * _Amp hours (Ah)_ describe the quantity of available charge or charge used.
 * _Voltage (V)_ describes the quantity of electromagnetic force in which charge carriers are being pushed in an electric current.
 * Voltage is always a relative measurement between two points.
 * _Wattage (W)_ is a convenience unit to describe electricity that includes amps and voltage, multiplied together (watts = amps * volts).
 * Volts and amps can be traded for each other in a current, as long as the overall amount of work (Wattage), stays the same. This is often done through induction.
 * _Power_ is a colloquial term that usually means wattage.
 * Circuits are closed loops that consists of a voltage _source_, a _load_, and a return path called _ground_ or _common_.
