## Types N-Channel/NPN & P-Channel/PNP

Both MOSFETs and BJTs come in two common flavors (there are actually more types of MOSFETs, but they're specialized and we'll cover them later). These two flavors describe whether or not they allow electrons or holes to flow (N-Type and P-Type) through them easily.

In MOSFETs, the kind that allows electrons (negative charge carriers) to flow are called _N-Channel_, and the corresponding type in BJTs are called _NPN_ transistors. 

Negative type (N-Channel MOSFETs and NPN BJTs) are by far the most commonly used transistors, so we'll spend the majority of our time on them.

The other kind, that allow holes (positive charge carriers) to flow easily are known as _P-Channel_ when referring to MOSFETs, and _PNP_ when referring to BJTs.





## Flywheel Diode

If using a Transistor or MOSFET to power a motor other things with a coil, such as a relay, you need to use a flywheel diode which prevents the BJT from receiving a current dump when the magnetic field in the coil collapses.

`1N4001` is a decent one to use
