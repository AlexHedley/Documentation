# Physics

[all P-N junctions emit light when electrons move through them. but most diodes are made in such a way that you can see inside.]

[when electrons move into the holes in the P-Type lattice, they move from a higher energy orbit to a lower energy orbit. when that happens, they lose energy. that energy is released in the form of photons (light particles)]

[specifically; the electrons move from the conduction band to valence band]

[in silicon, the electron orbital drop is very small, so the light released is low energy, and the photon escapes at a low frequency of vibration, in the infrared spectrum. (the color of light depends on it's frequency)]

[for this reason, LEDs are made of materials in which the electron orbital energy drop is much larger. so the photons released are at high energies, therefore higher frequencies]

## Types of LEDs

varying colors
 - `V`<sub>`f`</sub> generally increases with light frequency

| Color  | V<sub>f</sub> | I<sub>fmax</sub> |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Red    | 1.8V          | 15mA - 20mA      |
| Green  | 2.1V          | 20ma - 30mA      |
| Blue   | 3.4V - 3.6 V  | 20mA             |
| Yellow | 2.0V          | 15mA             |
| White  | 1.9V - 2.4V   | 30mA             |
