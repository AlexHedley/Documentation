# Two Diodes Sandwiched Together




## Operation

* **Active Region** - Amplifier mode: `I`<sub>`C`</sub> `= I`<sub>`B`</sub> `* β`
* **Saturation** - Transistor is fully "on:" `I`<sub>`C`</sub> `= I(saturation`
* **Cut-off** - Transistor is fully "off:" `I`<sub>`C`</sub> `= 0`


## Base, Collector, Emitter

![](../Sketches/BJT_diagrams.png)


 * **`V`<sub>`c`</sub>** - Voltage at the Collector
 * **`i`<sub>`B`</sub>** - Current at Base
 * **`V`<sub>`BE`</sub>** - Voltage from Base to Emitter

 
[Note: `VCC` comes from Common Voltage at all Collectors in an IC.]

## Beta (β)

Relationship between Base current and current flowing from Collector to Emitter.

Also known as `HFE`.

`I`<sub>`C`</sub> `= I`<sub>`B`</sub> `* β`


## NPN and PNP

Mnemonics:

* NPN = "Not pointing in."
* PNP = "Points in proudly."
