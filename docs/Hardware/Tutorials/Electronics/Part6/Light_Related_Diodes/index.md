# Intro

In addition to the general diodes examined previously that perform circuit functions, there are a number of other diodes that do some pretty interesting things to do with light, including Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs), Photodiodes, and Solar Cells.

### Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)

LEDs are a type of diode that emit photons (light) as electrons flow through the P-N junction. These are awesome! LEDs are everywhere around us; they're used as lights, indicators, and even display screens. 

These bar graph displays use LEDs to indicate a battery charge or an operating value:

Many modern [displays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED_display) also use LEDs to power their pixels, with each pixel containing three diodes; red, green, and blue. With each color (R, G, B) brightness controlled individually to create nearly any color.

### Photodiodes

Photodiodes are the opposite of LEDs, when photons enter, they get converted into electrical energy. They're often used as light sensors and this is also how solar panels work. By the way, a fun fact about LEDs; though not as efficient, they can also be used as photodiodes!

[photodiodes are often used in conjunction with transistors because they generate power, as opposed to a photoresistor, which requires power to use]

### Solar Panels

Solar panels are really just big, flat P-N junctions! In fact, they're technically photodiodes. :)
