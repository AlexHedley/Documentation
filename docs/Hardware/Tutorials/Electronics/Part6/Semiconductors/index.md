# Intro

Recall from chapter 1 that conductors are materials which consist of an atomic lattice that allows the free flow of electrons, and therefore electricity.

Some conductors can have their atomic structure altered by mixing in small amounts of impurities, in a process known as _doping_, to change their electrical conduction behavior. For instance, they can be doped to primarily allow the flow of electrons, or the flow of holes. These materials can then be placed together into discrete components in such a way that they will only conduct electricity in certain ways. For example, _diodes_ will only allow electricity to flow in one direction, whilst _transistors_ and _MOSFETs_ will only allow electricity to flow if a small amount of switching electricity is applied to a third leg, therefore creating a switch.

Semiconductors are the foundation of nearly all modern electronics. For example, a modern CPU has billions of transistors on a single chip, a many modern microcontrollers have millions. 


Today, silicon is the most common semiconductor material, but [germanium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanium) and various compounds of [gallium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium) are also used. During the first decade of mass semiconductor manufacturing, most of them were based on germanium.

In this chapter, we're going to cover:

 * How semiconductors work from a physical perspective.
 * What are some of the most common semiconductor components used in circuit design, including diodes (including LEDs), transistors, and MOSFETs.
 * Practical usage of various semiconductors for controlling electrical flow in circuits.

Along the way, we'll continue our exploration of circuit design, building on what we've learned up to this point, and adding semiconductor components to the mix.
