# Intro

In this lab, we're going to build a simple LED circuit that uses a resistor to limit the voltage and current, and is actuated by a push button.

[lab can be done in iCircuit, but is much more fun when actually built physically].

# Requirements

# Exercise 1: Single LED Circuit

## Step 1 - Build the Circuit

## Step 2 - Test

# Exercise 2: Series LED Circuit


## Step 1 - Build the Circuit

## Step 2 - Test

# Exercise 3: Parallel LED Circuit

## Step 1 - Build the Circuit

## Step 2 - Test


# [Next - Diode Logic Gate Lab](../Diode_Logic_Lab)
