# TODO

 * Add Negative Voltage to voltage page (current flowing in opposite direction)
 * Add Active/Passive to Source/Load/Return

 * Add Power Calculations to reference

 * Add Preferred Values of resistors to the resistors reference page. Good explanation here: http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/resistor/res_2.html

## Kirchoff's Laws



### Kirchoff's Voltage Law

[Kirchoff's Voltage Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws#Kirchhoff.27s_voltage_law_.28KVL.29) states that the sum of the voltages in any circuit loop (source -> load -> return/common) must be zero. Which means that if the source is 5V, then the total load must drop 5V to zero. Let's examine a typical single resistor circuit:

## Current Division

Parallel resistor networks have an interesting consequence; because the

Series:
100 x 3 = 300ohms

Parallel:
(1/900) 

By dividing the current among more than resistor, the overall power that the resistors can handle is higher.
