## Pre-requisite: Get EasyEDA

EasyEDA is a free, web-based EDA tool that you can either use in the browser or via their desktop app. Designs are generally stored online in their cloud, but you can also save them locally.

Before you can use it, you'll need to navigate to [EasyEDA.com](https://easyeda.com/), create an account, and either [download](https://easyeda.com/page/download) the desktop version of the editor or click on the "EasyEDA Designer" link in their navigation bar to open the editor:

## Step 1: Create a New Project

From the toolbar, choose **File > New > Project**:

Name your project _Meadow Tracker Wing_, or similar:

EasyEDA will then create a new empty project with a blank schematic drawing:
