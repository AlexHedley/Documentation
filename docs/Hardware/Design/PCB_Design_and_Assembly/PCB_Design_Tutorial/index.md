subtitle: Building a practical Meadow Wing with GNSS and atmospheric sensors.

The most effective way to learn PCB design is to actually design and build one. So that's what we'll do. In this tutorial, we're going to build a practical Meadow wing board that plugs into a Meadow and has a BME280 to track temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, as well as a high-quality GNSS (GPS) module.

This project represents a common IoT solution for logistics tracking and could easily be used as a jumping off point for a real life solution.

## Process

Along the way, we're going to cover the following:

 * Schematic Capture - Creating a drawing of the circuit parts that will comprise the PCB, including:
   * Reading and Understanding Datasheets
   * Component Selection
   * Creating Custom Schematic Symbols & PCB Footrpints
 * PCB Layout/Design
