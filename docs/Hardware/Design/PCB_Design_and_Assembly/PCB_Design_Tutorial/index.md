The most effective way to learn PCB design is to actually design and build one. So that's what we'll do. In this multipart tutorial, we're going to design and build a PCB that is a partial version of [Clima](https://store.wildernesslabs.co/collections/frontpage/products/clima-weather-station-kit) that includes  BME280 to track temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, and get its power from a solar power input. In the end, you'll come away with a general grasp of PCB design from start to finish.



## Process

Along the way, we're going to cover the following:

 * **[Schematic Design, AKA Capture](/Hardware/Design/PCB_Design_and_Assembly/PCB_Design_Tutorial/Schematic_Design)** - Creating a drawing of the circuit parts that will comprise the PCB, including:
   * Reading and Understanding Datasheets
   * Component Selection
   * Creating Custom Schematic Symbols & PCB Footrpints
 * **[PCB Layout/Design](/Hardware/Design/PCB_Design_and_Assembly/PCB_Design_Tutorial/PCB_Layout)** - Designing the physical PCB layout, including:
   * Layer Stackups
   * Component Placement
   * Routing
 * **[PCB Assembly](/Hardware/Design/PCB_Design_and_Assembly/PCB_Design_Tutorial/PCB_Assembly)** - Practical, at-home assembly of SMT and PTH PCBs.

This tutorial will take a hybrid approach, with most content in the form of a three-part video, along with reference textual content.
