## PCB Fabrication

In the [PCB Fabrication Guide](/Hardware/Design/PCB_Design_and_Assembly/PCB_Fabrication) we'll cover how to take your PCB designs and turn them into PCBs.

## PCB Assembly (PCBA) in a Home Lab

While production-scale PCB assembly is done with solder paste _stencil printers_, _pick-and-place_ machines, _reflow ovens_, and other specialized equipment, assembling prototype PCBs at home can be done with very simple and cheap tools. In fact, the minimum tooling required to do modern PCB assembly only includes:

 * Solder Paste in a Syringe
 * Tweezers
 * A Hot Plate

In the [PCB Assembly Guide](/Hardware/Design/PCB_Design_and_Assembly/PCB_Assembly) we'll cover everything you need to know to do PCBA at home.

## Important PCB Concepts [maybe move these]

### Through Hole (PTH) vs. Surface Mount (SMT/SMD)
