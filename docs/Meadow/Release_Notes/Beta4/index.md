# b4.0

W000t, b4.0 is here! This is a major release that includes a TON of new features, 
stabilizations, upgrades, and more across the entire Meadow platform. Major 
highlights include:

 * **WiFi Networking**
 * **Garbage Collector Tuning**
 * **Application Crash fix**

## Meadow.OS Improvements

### Networking

Yaaaasss! WiFi networking is up! After nearly two years of engineering, Networking 
communications via WiFi are now available to Meadow apps. 

### Application Crash

The dreaded application crash that got introduced a few beta releases back that prevents
Meadow applications from standing up for more than a few minutes has been fixed! [add 
details when avaialble]

### Garbage Collector Tuning

The Mono garbage collector that we use in Meadow.OS got a major tune-up, making it much 
more suited for our architecture and use case. You should find that garbage collection 
works far better now than it did before.

### Bug Fixes

* [#37 - Threading and event callback lockup](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/37) - Fixed!
* [#62 - Constant 10ms delay when calling Thread.Sleep()](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/62) - Fixed, timer resolution is now 1ms.
* [#67 - RgbPwmLed.StartBlink() does not have accurate timings](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/67) - Fixed, related to timer resolution.
* [#69 - Timer creep](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/69) - Fixed, also related to timer resolution
* [#77 - PWM duration with TimeScale.MicroSecond off by 10Âµs](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/77) - Fixed, math error. :)
* [#89 - All file system objects appear as files](https://github.com/WildernessLabs/Meadow_Issues/issues/89) - Fixed.


## Meadow.Core Improvements

### Serial/UART Communications

We did a major overhaul of the UART/Serial Port in Meadow for b4.0. Big changes include:
 * **Serial Port Events Fixed** - Serial port events now work, which enables more efficient 
   communications, without the need for a polling thread.
 * **New `ISerialMessagePort` class** - We fundamentally reworked the way legacy serial 
   communications work, and created an `ISerialMessagePort` class that modernizes them. 
   It's thread-safe and asynchronous by default, and massively simplifies communications
   with serial devices by taking a _message_ approach. We recommend using this class 
   instead of `ISerialPort` for serial communications from now on.
   
For more info, check out the awesome [Serial Communications Guide](/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/IO/Digital/Protocols/UART/).

### `FilterableObserver` Changes

We made some changes to the filterable observer:

* **Renamed `FilterableObserver` to `FilterableChangeObserver`.** - We made this naming change because the 
  `FilterableObserver`, as designed, was based on change notification and as such had `Old` and `New` 
  values, along with built in comparison. However, it became clear that we should also have a non histrionic
  version for cases where `Old` and `New` had no meaning, so we also:
* **Created a new `FilterableObserver` class that doesn't have histrionics.** - Currently, the various 
  Meadow.Core port classes used a standard `IObservable<out T>`, which was fine, but we wanted to extend
  the built-in filtering mechanism [**TBD.**]


## Meadow.Foundation

### GPS Drivers

[TBD]

### GPS/GNSS NMEA Processing

As part of our work to add GPS drivers, we completely re-worked, upgraded, and modernized the 
NMEA sentence parsing and decoding library. It now handles a wider array of sentence structures, 
is more fault tolerant, has a better API and is easier to add new decoders to.
