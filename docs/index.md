### February

#### 2022.February.17th (Thursday) 19:00 UTC
* **[Meadow - A Modern IoT Hardware and Software Development Platform**](https://www.meetup.com/DeveloperSouthCoast/events/283314062/)**

Meadow is a microcontroller and software ecosystem based upon .NET Standard 2.1.  In contrast to traditional embedded development systems, Meadow allows hardware development using modern languages (C#, and F#) with Visual Studio (Windows and Mac) and VS Code (Windows, Mac and Linux) with full access to the .NET framework.

With Meadow, developers are able to leverage their current software development techniques and knowledge to develop hardware products using the latest .NET technologies.  The system is designed to be easy to use and to allow developers to focus on core product development.

In this presentation we will look at the extensive collection of libraries and demonstrate how they can be used to perform a variety of tasks including:

* Getting started with Meadow
* Connect to a sensor to Meadow and record data from the sensor
* Control hardware using Meadow
* Use Meadow to take the sensor readings and control hardware based upon the readings

Finally we will look at the road map and current plans to make the platform even more awesome.
