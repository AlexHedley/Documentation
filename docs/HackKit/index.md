# Hack Kits

![](Hack_Kit_Pro.png)

Got an awesome Wilderness Labs Hack Kit and want to know what to build with it? If you just can't wait, here are a couple of awesome projects you can build with either one right now:

 * [Getting Started w/ Meadow by Controlling the Onboard RGB LED](https://www.hackster.io/wilderness-labs/getting-started-w-meadow-by-controlling-the-onboard-rgb-led-ea6bc0)
 * [Control an LED w/ Digital Output or PWM Ports Using Meadow](https://www.hackster.io/wilderness-labs/control-an-led-w-digital-output-or-pwm-ports-using-meadow-11005a)
 * [Control an RGB LED w/ Digital Output or PWM ports in Meadow](https://www.hackster.io/wilderness-labs/control-an-rgb-led-w-digital-output-or-pwm-ports-in-meadow-7fd611)
 * [Build Your Own Simon Game with Meadow](https://www.hackster.io/wilderness-labs/build-your-own-simon-game-with-meadow-3701d5)
